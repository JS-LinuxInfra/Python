# Python

Python scripting for everyday system engineering tasks along with tooling I have started to work on. The goal is to automate repetitive work, speed up troubleshooting, and improve my overall proficiency with Python. This will be an ongoing project.

## Scripts

These are my Python scripts. Each entry lists the name of the script and what the script does.

### Basic Syntax and Variables

1. `basic_hello_world.py`
   
Defines your name and prints a greeting.

2. `advanced_hello_world.py`
  
Defines the variables for a hello world script, greets the user and provides a return greeting.

3. `meals.py`
  
Defines variables for food eaten at various meals and prints what is eaten at each.

4. `integer.py`
  
Defines variables for several integers and performs a basic calculation.

5. `basic_calculation.py`

Prints a basic mathematical calculation to the terminal.

6. `exponents.py`
  
Performs modulo calculations on several variables and prints the output to the terminal.

7. `concatenation.py`

Defines multiple strings, concatenates them together and prints the output to the terminal.

8. `plus_equals.py`

Defines multiple variables, adds them together, and appends the output to the end of a string on the terminal.

9. `multi_line_string.py`
   
Defines a multi-line string and prints to the terminal.

10. `ascii_art.py`

Defines ASCII art and prints symmetrically to the terminal.

11. `print_name.py`

Defines a name to a VAR and prints to the terminal.

12. `first_letter.py`

Selects the first letter from a name, assigns to a second variable then prints the output to the terminal.

### Boolean Variables and if/elif/else statements

1. `boolean_variables.py`

Defines boolean variables, prints True or False to the terminal as well as the class of variable.

2. `if_statement.py`

Defines a variable, evaluates an if expression and prints the correct output to the terminal.

3. `multiple_if_statements.py`

Defines multiple variables, evaluates multiple expressions, prints expected output to the terminal.

4. `and_statement.py`

Defines multiple variables, evaluates an and statement, prints expected output to the terminal.

5. `or_statement.py`

Defines multiple variables, evaluates an or statement, prints expected output to the terminal.

6. `not_statement.py`

Defines multiple variables, evaluates a not statement, prints expected output to the terminal.

7. `else_statement.py`

Defines multiple variables, evaluates an else statement, prints expected output to the terminal.

8. `else_if_statement.py`

Defines multiple variables, evaluates an else if statement, prints expected output to the terminal.

9. `advanced_else_if_statement.py`

Defines multiple variables, evaluates an advanced else if statement, prints expected output to the terminal.

### Lists

1. `list_method.py`

Defines a list, removes the final integer and prints the remainder to the terminal.

2. `list_append.py*`

Defines a list, appends two additional integers, and prints the updated list to the terminal.

3. `list_elements.py`

Defines a list, defines zero-indexing list position and prints out employee 3.

4. `list_negative_index.py`
  
Defines a list, defines negative zero-indexing list position and prints out the last element.

5. `modify_list.py`

Defines a list, insert elements using positive and negative indexing, print modified list to the terminal.

6. `remove_list.py`

Defines a list, removes an element and prints updated list to the terminal.

7. `2d_list.py`

Create 2D list, update elements, print updated elements to the terminal.

8. `modify_2d_list.py`

Create 2D list, modify elements and print output to the terminal.

9. `advanced_modify_2d_list.py`

Modify 2D list via both insertion and removal of elements in customer data list, then print the updated list.

### Strings

1. `string_slice.py`

Creates two variables, slices a beginning range, prints the output, slices a range in the middle of a string, and prints this output to the terminal.

## Code

This is the code I have written. Each program details what the program does and what the end result ended up being.

1. `loveseat_project.py`

This code tracks inventory, determines a customer's order, calculates sales tax, and provides the customer with the total for their purchase including price of items purchased as well as sales tax.

2. `magic_8_ball.py`

This code takes the user's name, prompts them to ask a question, executes a random number generator, and the randomly decided integer then determines the string printed to the terminal to answer their question.

3. `sals_shipping.py`

This code takes the weight from a user, compares it to the available shipping options and provides the customer with the cost for each option based on the weight of what they are shipping.

4. `gradebook.py`

This code details multiple subjects and grades, determine pass/fail paramaters, modify via adding and removal of grades, print updated gradebook to terminal.
