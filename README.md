# Python
Python scripting for everyday system engineering tasks. The goal is to automate repetitive work, speed up troubleshooting, and improve my overall proficiency with Python. This will be an ongoing project.

## Scripts
These are my Python scripts. Each entry lists the name of the script and what the script does.

**basic_hello_world.py** Defines your name and prints a greeting.

**advanced_hello_world.py** Defines the variables for a hello world script, greets the user and provides a return greeting.

**meals.py** Defines variables for food eaten at various mealsand prints what is eaten at each.

**integer.py** Defines variables for several integers and performs a basic calculation.

**basic_calculation.py** Prints a basic mathematical calculation to the terminal.

**basic_calculation.py** Takes two variables, multiples them, and prints the output to the terminal.

**exponents.py** Multiplies and exponentiates several variables.

**exponents.py** Performs module calculations on several variables and prints the output to the terminal.

**concatenatation.py** Defines multiple strings, concatenates them together and prints the output to the terminal.

**plus_equals.py** Defines multiple variables, adds them together, and appends the output to the end of a string on the terminal.

**multi_line_string.py** Defines a multi-line string and prints to the terminal.

**ascii_art.py** Defines ascii art and prints out symmetrically to the terminal.

## Code
This is the code I have written. Each program details what the program does and what the end result ended up being.

**loveseat_project.py** This code tracks inventory, determines a customer's order, calculates sales tax, and provides the customer with the total for their purchase including price of items purchased as well as sales tax.
