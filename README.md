## Scripts

These are my Python scripts. Each entry lists the name of the script and what the script does.

### Basic Syntax and Variables

1. `basic_hello_world.py`
   
Defines your name and prints a greeting.

2. `advanced_hello_world.py`
  
Defines the variables for a hello world script, greets the user and provides a return greeting.

3. `meals.py`
  
Defines variables for food eaten at various mealsand prints what is eaten at each.

4. `integer.py`
  
Defines variables for several integers and performs a basic calculation.

5. `basic_calculation.py`

Prints a basic mathematical calculation to the terminal.

6. `exponents.py`
  
Multiplies and exponentiates several variables.

7. `exponents.py`
  
Performs module calculations on several variables and prints the output to the terminal.

8. `concatenatation.py`

Defines multiple strings, concatenates them together and prints the output to the terminal.

9. `plus_equals.py`

Defines multiple variables, adds them together, and appends the output to the end of a string on the terminal.

10. `multi_line_string.py`
   
Defines a multi-line string and prints to the terminal.

11. `ascii_art.py`

Defines ascii art and prints out symmetrically to the terminal.




**boolean_variables.py** Defines boolean variables, prints True or False to the terminal as well as the class of variable.

**if_statement.py** Defines a variable, evaluates an if expression and prints the correct output to the terminal.

**multiple_if_statements.py** Defines multiple variables, evaluates multiple expressions, prints expected output to the terminal.

**and_statement.py** Defines multiple variables, evaluates an and statement, prints expected output to the terminal.

**or_statement.py** Defines multiple variables, evaluates an or statement, prints expected output to the terminal.

**not_statement.py** Defines multiple variables, evaluates a not statement, prints expected output to the terminal.

**else_statement.py** Defines multiple variables, evaluates an else statement, prints expected output to the terminal.

**else_if_statement.py** Defines multiple variables, evaluates an else if statement, prints expected output to the terminal.

**advanced_else_if_statement.py** Defines multiple variables, evaluates an advanced else if statement, prints expected output to the terminal.




**list_method.py** Defines a list, removes the final integer and prints the remainder to the terminal.

**list_append.py** Defines a list, appends two additional integers, and prints the updated list to the terminal.

**list_elements.py** Defines a list, defines zero-indexing list position and prints out employee 3.

**list_negative_index.py** Defines a list, defines negative zero-indexing list position and prints out the last element

**modify_list.py** Defines a list, insert elements using positive and negative indexing, pring modified list to the terminal.

**remove_list.py** Defines a list, removes an element and prints updated list to the terminal.

**2d_list.py** Create 2D list, update elements, print updated elements to the terminal.

**modify_2d_list.py** Create 2D list, modify elements and print output to the terminal.

**advanced_modify_2d_list.py** Modify 2D list via both insertion and removal of elements in customer data list, then print the updated list.

Output:
[['Ken', 'American', 9], ['Tanya', 'Ukrainian', 9], ['Madison', 'Indian', 7]]

## Code
This is the code I have written. Each program details what the program does and what the end result ended up being.

**loveseat_project.py** This code tracks inventory, determines a customer's order, calculates sales tax, and provides the customer with the total for their purchase including price of items purchased as well as sales tax.

**magic_8_ball.py** This code takes the user's name, prompts them to ask a question, executes a random number generator, and the randomly decided integer then determines the string printed to the terminal to answer their question.

**sals_shipping.py** This code takes the weight from a user, compares it to the available shipping options and provides the customer with the cost for each option based on the weight of what they are shipping.

**gradebook.py** This code details multiple subjects and grades, determine pass/fail paramaters, modify via adding and removal of grades, print updated gradebook to terminal.
